#horiseon_refactor

This assignment was to demonstrate my ability to make changes to a html and css file for a webpage that needed better optimization. 
This was done by removing the many div child elements and from there, reorganizing some of the other section
As well as adding alt elements to the images.

As a result I have practiced more in how to design a webpage using html and css elements.
